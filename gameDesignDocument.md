# Welcome to the Short and Tall Wiki!

## Objective

For as long as possible, avoid the red blocks on the ground and get the highest possible score. Collect multiplier in order to get higher scores. Complete missions to unlock higher multiplier. 

## Gameplay Mechanics

Players can only jump and change their height. Multiplier hangs in the air, not affected by gravity. 

When the player becomes taller, they get heavier and are not able to jump. 

## Level Design

There is only one level, because it's an infinite runner. Obstacles are scrolled in, at varying heights. Occasionally, multiplier will appear in the sky.
