## Objective
For as long as possible, avoid the red blocks on the ground and get the highest possible score. When tall blue walls appear, tap right to get large enough to crash through them. 

## Gameplay Mechanics
Players can only jump and change their height. When the player becomes taller, they get heavier and are not able to jump. 

## Level Design
There is only one level, because it's an infinite runner. Obstacles are scrolled in, at varying heights. Very rarely, multiplier will appear on the floor to pick up.
